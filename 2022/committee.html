            <p>Mark Coletti is a research scientist with the Oak Ridge National
                Laboratory (ORNL), and he received his Ph.D. in Computer Science
                from George Mason University in 2014. His main research focus is
                improving understanding of evolutionary algorithms within HPC
                contexts, particularly in petascale and exascale environments.
                His technical background includes evolutionary computation,
                machine learning, agent-based modeling, software engineering,
                image processing, and geoinformatics.
